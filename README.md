# Moxie, a study on compressing the plasma state

We study VAEs and how they can be used to compress information from diagnostic data into a representation of the plasma state. 

## Installation 

You must install the main `moxie` package. This is done by cloning the repo, and running `pip install -e .` within the repo dir (i.e., directory with `setup.py`)

### Usage 

Once installing, you can make your own experiment in `experiments/`.  
See `experiments/Example/` for an example experiment. 
- `run.py`
- `search.py`
